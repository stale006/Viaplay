How to run the app?

1 - Run npm install in command line

2 - Run npm start in command line to start the app.

3 - The app runs on localhost server 3000 port created using Express.

What Tools did I used along with reasons 

1 - Bootstrap
 
    This Frameworks makes it easy to create web pages on mobile and desktop devices. 
    And with fewer lines of code many good looking features can be implemented.
  
2 - Jquery
 
    This framework makes the app compatible in all types of the browsers.
    It even overcomes the shortcoming of javascript.
    And the task can be accomplished with fewer lines of code. 
  
3 - Grunt
  
    This tool allow to write javascript in es6 format and css in sass format.
  
Intentionally leave stuff out ?
  
    I really do not think I have left any of stuff.
    Igot no reply from Trailer addict api to get a personal Api key so based on conversation with your developers I went to use youtube embed for the video.
    I wanted to use SASS and ES6 for creating the app. But at the end I did not make use of it.
    One more place where I could have done is proper error handling of API.
    It took me 4 days to do the above task.
